# Regular Expression Tutorial: Matching an Email

Regular Expressions are a JavaScript tool which simplifies the validation process of common frameworks for specific strings. Such common frameworks including but not limited to - usernames, emails, passwords and URLs. Regular expressions often contains a set series of special characters that follow specific frameworks to ensure that the framework is being properly verified.


## Summary

Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.
In this tutorial we will be exploring how Regular Expressions or Regex for short with an email regex as our example. Refer to the line of code below as this is the universal line of code for email regex's.

/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/

In summary, the regex is a literal template which includes three different strings.
- The first string is followed by an @
- The first string is limited to letters,numbers, underscores and hyphens
- The second string is followed by a .
- The second string is limited to any letter
- The third and final string is limited to letters and can only contain a string from 2-6 characters

We will go in further detail throughout the tutorial.
